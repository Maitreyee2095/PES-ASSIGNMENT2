# PES-ASSIGNMENT2
Code for Assignment 2 for PES, ECEN 5813, fall2020

OS: Ubuntu Version: 16.04 Compiler:GCC Version :5.4.0

THIS REPOSITORY CONSISTS OF:
1)cbfifo.c 
  cbfifo.h
  test_cbfifo.c
  makefile
2)llfifo.c
  llfifo.h
  test_llfifo.c
  makefile


THIS ASSIGNMENT IS TO IMPLEMENT FIFO IN TWO WAYS, ONE USING LINKED LIST AND OTHR USING CIRCULAR BUFFER
CERTAIN PROPERTIES OF BOTH AS DESCRIBED IN THE PROBLEM STATEMENT ARE:

LINKED LIST
1) PASSES POINTERS OF ELEMENTS TO THE LIST, DOES NOT COPY THE ELEMENTS(I.E DATA) ACCROSS THE LIST.
2) INITIALIZES LINKED LIST WITH CERTAIN CAPACITY, TO AVOID RECALLING OF MALLOC
3) IF USER PUSHES EXTRA NODES THE LINKED LIST GROWS SLIENTLY.

CIRCULAR BUFFER
1) IS OF FIXED LENGTH
2) COPIES THE DATA ACROSS THE LIST 
3) WHILE DEQUEING IF USER ASKS FOR MORE DATA THAN THE CAPACITY,IT WILL DEQUEUE THE ELEMENTS TO ITS CAPACITY AND SET LENGTH TO 0


compiling the make file : download the make file and all the c files and h files in one folder, open the terminal in the folder and just enter make, code will compile itself to create an object executable file llfifo.o.
